        <h2 class="contents">About SSN College of Engineering</h2><p class="contents">Welcome to a new chapter in SSN Campus! Welcome to SSN Intranet!!! IT is happening here!!!!! Founded by Padma Bhushan Dr. Shiv Nadar, Chairman, HCL Group that played a key role in the development of India's IT sector, the SSN institutions seek to carry forward the spirit of excellence that characterizes HCL's ventures. Together, the SSN institutions are committed to scripting a unique chapter of excellence in education and research, in vital fields like engineering, biomedical engineering, IT, and management. Recently, we have taken up a new eLearning initiative that aims at effective use of current technology to enhance the teaching-learning process and to make this teaching-learning process learner driven. It is being implemented in such a way to supplement the class room teaching and not to replace it. This site is currently at experimental stage. For your information, this is a wiki site and we use TWiki implementation. You can visit the TWiki Web at our site to learn about the wiki implementation that we use.</p>
