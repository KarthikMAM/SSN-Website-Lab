      <img src="http://www.ssn.edu.in/wp-content/themes/ssn/images/inner_header.jpg" height="200" width="500" class="contents" style="float:right">
      <p class="contents">A vibrant learning experience is about more than just classroom sessions. Guest lectures, symposia, seminars and conferences expose students to key insights, new ideas and a chance to engage with peers and experts in discussion and debate. Our 1000-seater auditorium facilitates this free interplay of ideas. Air conditioned and equipped with modern equipment such as multimedia projectors and high quality sound systems, it has large lobbies and verandahs, which are ideal venues for conferences and exhibitions. Many dignitaries have graced this imposing edifice, the most prominent being the then President of India, His Excellency, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. For smaller seminars and meetings, there is a mini auditorium which can hold 300 people. With a growing number of seminars and symposia being held across disciplines, each department also has its own fully-equipped, capacious seminar hall.</p>
      <h2 class="contents">Counselling Centre</h2>
      <p class="contents">Negotiating the complexities of the modern world can be daunting for a young adult. So can choosing the right path when it comes to further education or a career. Our qualified, experienced counselor resides on campus and is always on call to help students with their personal, academic or professional issues.</p>
      <h2 class="contents">Health Care</h2>
      <p class="contents">Physical health is the bulwark of a keen mind. To ensure that our students have access to medicines and medical advice, a well-stocked dispensary is provided in the Bio-Medical department and our campus doctor is on hand to respond to our students’ medical needs. In case of an emergency, we have arranged for a van to be available at all times for immediate transport to a hospital. Our full-time campus doctor, who also serves as an Assistant Professor:</p>
      <h2 class="contents">Hostel</h2>
      <p class="contents">Our hostels are convenient, comfortable homes away from home with spacious rooms and ample storage. Internet access, via w-fi or wired connections, keeps our students plugged into online educational resources. Each hostel building is designed to be an independent unit with its own kitchen, dining hall, reading room/library, television and telephone facilities. There are separate hostels for boys and girls.</p>
      <h2 class="contents">Staff Quarters</h2>

      <h2 class="contents">Library</h2>
      <p class="contents">Two elements define an outstanding library: great resources and the right atmosphere. The SSN Central Library offers our students both factors. With a catalogue of over 46,000 volumes and an online journal database with a link to IEL (IEEE & IEE), ACM, Science Direct, SpringerLink.com and EBSCO, the library offers students a wealth of knowledge resources to aid in their quest for knowledge. The library stocks 206 national and 114 international journals and magazines to keep students abreast of the latest findings and research. And the resources are constantly being expanded, with around 1,200 books added each semester. To add to the wealth of options, SSN also has institutional membership in the libraries of IIT-Madras, Anna University, British Council, MALIBNET (Madras Library Network, Chennai) and DELNET (Developing Library Network, New Delhi). Our library is not limited to textual resources. We also offer 110 NPTEL video lectures and 129 web courses in various disciplines, which can be accessed throughout the campus via our intranet. Students can also connect with interactive lectures through Anna EDUSAT Ku-Band. As for the right surroundings for serious study, the library is completely air-conditioned, spacious, and designed to be a quiet, contemplative space. Open from 8.00 a.m. to 8.30 p.m., the library’s extended working hours make it easy for students to fit library research time into their demanding academic schedules.</p>

      <h2 class="contents">Transport</h2>
      <p class="contents">Located as we are in a suburb of Chennai, transport is a key consideration. Our extensive fleet of buses constitutes one of the best transport systems operated by a college in the city, connecting students to every corner of Chennai to our campus. Wherever you live within Chennai, reaching college on time and getting back home are never going to be an issue.</p>
      <h2 class="contents">Wi-Fi</h2>
      <p class="contents">Our students will to be among the first generations of Indians to work in a completely connected environment. We prepare them for the digital era with access to a wireless network (Wi-Fi) across the campus, in addition to traditional wired internet, intranet and mail access. The Wi-Fi network covers classrooms as well as common areas. This means that students can access online learning materials and resources whether they’re relaxing on the lawns, participating in activities in the auditorium or sports complex, or back in their own hostel room. Our Wi-Fi facility has become an exemplar for other institutions and several delegations have been sent to study our Wi-Fi setup and implementation.</p>
      <h2 class="contents">Cafeteria</h2>
      <p class="contents">Intense mental exertion exerts a toll on the body. That is why we’ve spared no expense to provide our students and staff (as well as their guests) with on-campus access to tasty, nutritious and affordable food. The two-storied cafeteria building easily accommodates our large and growing student population and the extended hours make it the perfect spot for a sustaining snack in the middle of a busy schedule in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
