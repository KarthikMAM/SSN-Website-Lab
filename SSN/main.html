      <p class="contents">Welcome to a new chapter in SSN Campus! Welcome to SSN Intranet!!! IT is happening here!!!!! Founded by Padma Bhushan Dr. Shiv Nadar, Chairman, HCL Group that played a key role in the development of India's IT sector, the SSN institutions seek to carry forward the spirit of excellence that characterizes HCL's ventures. Together, the SSN institutions are committed to scripting a unique chapter of excellence in education and research, in vital fields like engineering, biomedical engineering, IT, and management. Recently, we have taken up a new eLearning initiative that aims at effective use of current technology to enhance the teaching-learning process and to make this teaching-learning process learner driven. It is being implemented in such a way to supplement the class room teaching and not to replace it. This site is currently at experimental stage. For your information, this is a wiki site and we use TWiki implementation. You can visit the TWiki Web at our site to learn about the wiki implementation that we use.</p>
      <h2 class="contents">History</h2>

      <p class="contents">SSN College of Engineering with its vision of being a centre of Excellence in IT and Emerging Technologies established the Centre for Crystal Growth in 2005 to carryout relevant and appropriate R and D and extensive work on this important interdisciplinary area. The Centre for Crystal Growth (CCG) proposes to streamline and co-ordinate research activities in crystalline materials with Academic Institutions, Universities and Research Organisations. The centre aims to provide a pool of Crystal Growth experts to advise and assist students and industrial people in the area of crystal growth and technology ranging from construction to communication industry. The centre will actively involve in collaborative projects with industry and government funding agencies. This includes R&D projects in aspects of crystal growth and technology. Moreover, the centre has identified specific niche areas for further research and development like nonlinear and ferroelectrics crystals, thin film technology for solar energy and photonic devices and various Crystal Growth techniques.</p>
